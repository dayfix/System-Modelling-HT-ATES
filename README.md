# System-Modelling-HT-ATES
System modelling code created by David Geerts for the PUSH-IT project and used as bases for publications in academic journals.
This system modelling is described in those papers that are to be published as well as a deliverable from the PUSH-IT project. 
If this code is used in other academic work, please cite the papers from Geerts accordingly.

The ATES_obj_publish is found and explained more clearly in the other github repository from dayfix and in another paper as well (to be published).

This code simulates a District heating system and calculates the economic and environmetnal variables.
Currently only the geothermal well, solar collector, HT-ATES and gas boiler are implemented.
